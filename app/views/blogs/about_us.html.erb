Back in 2002 I stumbled upon an article about ‘Blogging’. I didn’t know it at the time but that moment changed my life. I know that statements like that belong on those cheesy ‘buy my $1000 training program’ sites (don’t worry I’m not selling anything more than a book) but it is actually true.

Within 24 hours of reading the article I had started my own Blog – a personal blog where I’ve explored issues of Pop Culture, Spirituality and Blogging ever since. I’ve learned so much from the experience of that blog that I’ve since started many other blogs.

As my blogs have grown in popularity and have begun to generate income Blogging has grown from a hobby (some would say an obsession), to a part time job through to a fully fledged business in recent times. I have slowly built my blogging into an income source that has enabled me to dedicate more and more time to the medium to the point where I am currently a full time blogger – a ProBlogger.

If you want to read an extended version of my story I’ve written it at Becoming a ProBlogger. You might also like to visit my ProBlogger in the Press page or if you have a few minutes check out this keynote I gave at the World Domination Summit in which I share some of my story.
